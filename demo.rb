# Oops! Ben doesn't have anything to toast with so he gets a null pointer exception
# Lets try and fix this so toast doesn't blow up...

# Now that they toasted, they try and pay
# Oops! Again, Ben doesn't have a drink, so he can't calculate the price
# We could fix this the same way, but we are seeing a pattern emerge...

# Lets instead order Ben a tall glass of null object
[eric, jeff, dberk, ben].map(&:toast)

# Now we can calculate what we owe
